To get to the End dimension you need to find a portal in a stronghold and insert 12 eyes of ender. The Ender Dragon flys around the island and lands in the middle once in a while. The only way to kill it is to destroy the end crystals on top of each obsidian tower first. This is because thecrystals heal the dragon nonstop. Once the Ender Dragon has been slain it will drop LOTS of exp and a dragon egg.</p>
