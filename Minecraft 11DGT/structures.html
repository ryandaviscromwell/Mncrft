                <img class="profile" src="Image/Desert_temple.png" alt="temple">
                <h3>Desert Temple</h3>
                <p>The desert temple can be found in the desert. When you walk inside a desert temple there will be block patterns in the middle of the structure. If you mine the blocks in the middle you will see a chest room far below but beware if you step on the pressure plate at the center of the chest room it will set off tnt and everything will explode. There is 4 chests and can contain very good loot like diamonds or enchanted books. </p>

                <p>The pillager outpost can be found in any biome a village can be found. The poutpost will be guarded by many pillagers who have crossbows. They also have a captured iron golem in a prison. If you climb to the highest floor of the outpost you can find a chest which can contain helpful items. But be carful if you kill thepillager with a banner it will leave you with a bad omen affect which means if you enter a village a raid will start with more powerful mobs.</p>
